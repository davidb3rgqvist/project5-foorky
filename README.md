## Project Overview

The frontend of **Foorky 2.0** is built using **React.js** and **React Bootstrap**, following best practices in component-based architecture. This frontend is designed to be scalable, modular, and efficient, making use of reusable components and ensuring an excellent user experience across multiple devices.

The frontend connects to the **Foorky 2.0** backend, which is a Django REST API, using secure authentication mechanisms and performs all operations like recipe creation, management, and user interactions.

## Understanding Agile Project Management

In this project, I have followed the principles of **Agile Project Management**. Agile emphasizes iterative development. User stories, acceptance criteria, and key features are developed incrementally, ensuring that the product evolves. By breaking down the project into user stories, I ensure a focus on delivering value in small, manageable increments.

## Deployment

Both the **Foorky 2.0** frontend and backend were deployed using **Heroku**.

### Backend Deployment
- The backend was deployed using Heroku with the following steps:
  1. Install `gunicorn` and configure `Procfile` for production.
  2. Configure `settings.py` for Heroku, including `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DATABASES`, and static file management.
  3. Push the code to Heroku and run database migrations.

Deployed Backend URL: [Backend API](https://project5-api-a299de19cbb3.herokuapp.com)

### Frontend Deployment
- The React frontend was deployed to Heroku with the following steps:
  1. Build the app using `npm run build`.
  2. Use `static.json` to configure routes for React Router.
  3. Push the code to Heroku, ensuring the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable is set.

## Bug Fixes

1. **"Page Not Found" on Edit Recipe**
   - **Issue:** Attempting to edit a recipe resulted in a "Page Not Found" error.
   - **Resolution:** Fixed by passing the recipe data via `state` when navigating to the `/create-recipe` route. This allowed the existing route to handle both creating and editing recipes without requiring additional route definitions.

 **Negative Value Allowed for Cook Time**
   - **Issue:** Users could input negative values in the "Cook Time" field, leading to invalid data.
   - **Resolution:** Added validation to restrict input below 0 using `min="0"` in the backend as well as checking `formData.cook_time < 0` in the frontend to ensure negative values are not accepted.
